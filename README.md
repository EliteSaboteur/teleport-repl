# Component Playground

## Purpose

Allow fast experimentation and iteration over the JSON schema used to describe
components (for now, in the future maybe entire projects).

## Setup

```
npm i && \
cd ./live-previewers/react && npm i && \
cd ../vue && npm i
```

## Running

Run main playground which showed the json, code and live preview screens:
`npm run dev`

Run react previewer project:
`npm run start-react-previewer`

Run vue previewer project:
`npm run start-vue-previewer`
